# CLAWDIS 🦞

> *"EXFOLIATE! EXFOLIATE!"* — A space lobster, probably

**CLAWDIS** is a WhatsApp-to-AI gateway that lets your AI assistant live in your pocket. Built for [Clawd](https://clawd.me), a space lobster who needed a TARDIS.

## What is this?

CLAWDIS (née Warelay) bridges WhatsApp to AI coding agents like [Tau/Pi](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono). Send a message, get an AI response. It's like having a genius lobster on call 24/7.

```
┌─────────────┐      ┌──────────┐      ┌─────────────┐

```

## Features

- 📱 **WhatsApp Integration** — Uses Baileys for WhatsApp Web protocol
- 🤖 **AI Agent Gateway** — Pi/Tau only (Pi CLI in RPC mode)
- 💬 **Session Management** — Maintains conversation context across messages
- 🔔 **Heartbeats** — Periodic check-ins so your AI doesn't feel lonely

## The Name

**CLAWDIS** = CLAW + TARDIS

Because every space lobster needs a time-and-space machine to travel through WhatsApp messages. It's bigger on the inside (130k+ tokens of context).

The Doctor has a TARDIS. Clawd has a CLAWDIS. Both are blue. Both are a bit chaotic. Both are loved.

# Install
pnpm install

## Why "Warelay"?

The original name was **Warelay** (WhatsApp + Relay). It worked. It was fine. 

But then Clawd happened, and suddenly we needed something with more... *personality*. 

CLAWDIS was born. The lobster approved. 🦞
